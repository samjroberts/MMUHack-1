## GreatUniHack '17 Project: SafeStride
--------------------------------------------

Thanks for checking out our repo! 


## The idea: a safer route home
--------------------------------------------

The idea is simple. Mapping applications give you the fastest route between A and B,
but this often takes you through places where you no longer feel safe. What if we can 
run open source crime data through some an algorithm that will determine the 
statisically safest route home?

You're welcome.
